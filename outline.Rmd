        * Math
        * Conditional execution
        * Repetition
    - Natural vs. Formal language
        * Natural language is spoken, ambiguous, and redundant
        * Formal language is literal, unambiguous, and concise

    - Show how to create a script file and run a simple ```print()``` statement
3. Exploring the ```data.frame```
    - Open a tab-delimited file in Excel, explore data
    - Read data in R
        * Briefly introduce the variable, function, and argument components of the ```read.table()``` call
        * Look at data in RStudio
        * Each column has a data type show ```str()```--define data types
        * Make a scatterplot
4. Exercise
    - Open the text file but try other arguments
    - Plot the data using different plot arguments
